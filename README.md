## Project
This project is a meal planner. You can define your profile (age, gender, height, weight, activity level and health goals). Then, using the Food Database screen, you can search for food items, and add them to your meal planner. In the Meals Planning screen, you'll find all your items organized by day and selected meal. This allows you to see the total calories for each day and meal.
Our application is designed to make your life easier and help you achieve your health goals. 

## How to set up it
You can clone this Git repo, and install the necessary dependencies using the package.json file. All that's left to do is launch Expo and get the application running. 

## How to use it
First, go to the "Health Goals" screen. There, you'll need to fill in the short questionnaire to define your goals. Next, go to the "Food Database" screen and choose your items. Finally, you can see your schedule in the "Meals Planning" screen.
